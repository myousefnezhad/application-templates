Application Templates
=================================

# Overview

This repository contains my personal developed collection of application templates for building AI-oriented applications using Rust, Python, and Kotlin.

It is designed to help developers quickly bootstrap modern, production-ready systems that integrate large language models (LLMs), agents, and data-driven workflows.


# Included Templates

## 🐍 Python

The Python templates focus on LLM-based applications, including:
	•	AI agents
	•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

These examples demonstrate practical patterns for building intelligent systems with modern LLM frameworks.


## 🦀 Rust

The Rust workspace provides a fully integrated backend system, including:
	•	Axum-based web services
	•	Web-based Agent UI (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Askama templates)
	•	Local asset loading
	•	Chat interfaces
	•	MCP (Model Context Protocol) examples
	•	Command-line agent tools

It integrates with:
	•	PostgreSQL for user management, sessions, and application data
	•	Redis for caching and message coordination

This setup is suitable for building high-performance, scalable AI services.


## ☕ Kotlin

The Kotlin examples include advanced frontend implementations using:
	•	Compose Multiplatform
	•	Kobweb

These templates share business logic across platforms and demonstrate modern, cross-platform UI development for AI-driven applications.

# Goals
	•	Provide production-ready starter templates
	•	Demonstrate best practices for AI application architecture
	•	Enable rapid prototyping and deployment
	•	Encourage community contributions


# Roadmap

More templates and examples will be added over time, including additional AI workflows, integrations, and deployment patterns.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome.


# Usage

Feel free to use, modify, and extend this repository for your own projects. If you find it useful, contributions and feedback are appreciated.
