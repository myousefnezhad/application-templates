"""
Checkpoint loader for the official Gemma 4 bf16 safetensors checkpoint
(`google/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it`).

Unlike the original GPT-OSS loader, Gemma 4's public checkpoint is NOT in the
MXFP4 block/scale format - it is plain bf16. So this file is a thin wrapper
around `safetensors.safe_open` with no dequantisation. (If you instead grab a
quantised variant such as the NVFP4 or GGUF checkpoints, this loader will not
work as-is - those need their own dequant paths.)

Gemma 4 stores all decoder weights under the `model.language_model.` prefix,
and the MoE experts are stored as *stacked* tensors:
    model.language_model.layers.{i}.experts.gate_up_proj   # (num_experts, ...)
    model.language_model.layers.{i}.experts.down_proj      # (num_experts, ...)
